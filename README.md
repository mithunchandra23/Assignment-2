# Assignment-2

This repository contains Python scripts for two tasks: checking whether a number is even or odd and calculating the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a loop.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Takes an integer input from the user.
2. Checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
3. Displays the result accordingly.

### Features:
- Takes an integer as input from the user.
- Uses an if-else statement to check if the number is even or odd.
- Displays a message indicating whether the number is even or odd.
  

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

### Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Uses a `for` loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50.
2. Calculates the sum of all integers in this range.
3. Displays the final sum.

### Features:
- Iterates over numbers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.
- Sums all the numbers in this range.
- Displays the total sum of the integers.
